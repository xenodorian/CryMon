# CryMon — shared source, two (plus) ports

Web is the base. Dreamcast and the R36S SDL port consume the same content
and the same sprites. Do not keep a second copy of the game in C tables.

```
content/                  JSON source of truth
public/sprites/           art source of truth
src/game/                 web engine (loads JSON)
native/                   R36S / PortMaster SDL2 (640×480)
ports/dreamcast/          Dreamcast runtime (bakes JSON + sprites to C)
love/                     LÖVE port (still has its own data.lua — keep it in sync with content/, or replace it)
backups/dreamcast-pre-fuse/  frozen DC snapshot from before the fuse
```

Repos:

- **xenodorian/CryMon** — canonical. This tree.
- **xenodorian/BeelzFight** `crymon-dreamcast/` — DC working copy. Must not
  drift from CryMon `content/` + `public/sprites/`.

## What is shared vs what is not

**Shared (edit once):**

- `content/species.json` — stats, moves, spells
- `content/items.json` — bag/shop
- `content/maps.json` — ASCII maps, solid tiles, tile art keys
- `content/dialogue.json` — every talk beat, intro, ending, speaker names
- `content/world.json` — start bag, map names, warps, encounters, trainer kits, NPC marks, formulas
- `public/sprites/` — walk cycles, portraits, monsters, items, props

**Per port (do not try to unify):**

- Rendering (canvas vs PVR framebuffer vs SDL)
- Input (keyboard / touch vs Maple vs gptokeyb)
- Audio
- The battle/menu state machine implementation (same formulas, different code)

Formulas in `world.json` `formulas` are the contract. Ports implement them;
they do not invent a second capture/XP rule.

## Web build

```
npm run dev        # 0.0.0.0:8080
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`src/game/data.ts` imports the JSON. `src/game/engine.ts` is the loop.
Change dialogue → save JSON → preview refreshes.

## Dreamcast build

Toolchain: `sh-elf-gcc`, `mkdcdisc`.

```
cd ports/dreamcast
python3 ../../tools/bake_content.py --content ../../content --out src
python3 tools/gen_sprites.py ../../public/sprites
make
make cdi
```

Baker uppercases talk text and folds punctuation for the 8×8 bitmap font.
That is a display transform, not a second script.

`src/content_*.inc` and `src/sprites.h` are generated. Never author them.

## R36S / PortMaster

```
python3 native/pack_rom_zips.py    # packs public/sprites into gfx_blob.bin
```

`native/crymon.c` still has some inlined maps from an older sync. Prefer
fixing it by reading `content/` (or a baked header) over growing those
tables. Handheld zip: `public/rom/CryMon-ports.zip`.

## Workflow for a content change

1. Edit `content/*.json` and/or `public/sprites/`.
2. Confirm web preview.
3. Bake DC includes (and sprites.h if art changed).
4. Rebuild DC only if you need a new CDI this turn.
5. If you are on BeelzFight, copy the JSON back to CryMon the same turn.

## Abandoned

- SNES / `.sfc` / 65816. Do not restore.

## Backups

`backups/dreamcast-pre-fuse/` holds the last DC `main.c` with hardcoded
tables, Claude's overnight reports, the old `gen_sprites.py`, and a tar
of `art/` + placeholder sprites. Use it to remember a DC-only quirk.
Do not copy those tables forward.
